The definition of trust is a very deep and understandable for usual person. Let's briefly review of what [wiki says about the trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(social_science)):

> In a social context, trust has several connotations.[1] Definitions of trust[2][3] typically refer to a situation characterized by the following aspects: one party (trustor) is willing to rely on the actions of another party (trustee); the situation is directed to the future. In addition, the trustor (voluntarily or forcedly) abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee. As a consequence, the trustor is uncertain about the outcome of the other's actions; they can only develop and evaluate expectations. The uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the trustor if the trustee will not behave as desired.
> Trust can be attributed to relationships between people. It can be demonstrated that humans have a natural disposition to trust and to judge trustworthiness that can be traced to the neurobiological structure and activity of a human brain. Some studies indicate that trust can be altered e.g. by the application of oxytocin.[4]

Every time when I'm reading this definition I understand nothing and I start asking myself, what I feel and how I fell about this concept. My thoughts about this are flying to the sky :). I read many articles about trusting and etc and they don't give any silver bullet, only some food for the brain. 

A few months ago the time I found one interesting implementation for this topic. You can be a hero and follow different strategies about trusting. At the end of game, you can see a result of selected options. 

The game theory helps us to understand, why and how we trust.
